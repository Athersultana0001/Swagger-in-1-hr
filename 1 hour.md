Welcome to the course! In this session, we'll provide an overview of what Swagger is and why it's essential in modern software development. 🤝

### What is Swagger? 🤔

Swagger is an open-source framework that simplifies API documentation, design, and testing. It provides a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and consume them. 📖

Let's dive deeper into Swagger's core concepts, such as the OpenAPI Specification, and understand how it can benefit your projects. 🕵️‍♂️

### OpenAPI Specification 📘

The OpenAPI Specification is a language-agnostic format for describing RESTful APIs. It allows you to define endpoints, request and response formats, authentication, and more in a structured way. 📝

## 3. Installing Swagger 🛠️ (5 minutes) 🧰

Now that you understand what Swagger is, let's install the necessary tools to start using it in your projects. ⚙️

### Maven Integration 🏗️

You can easily integrate Swagger with Maven by adding the appropriate dependencies to your project's `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## 4. Creating a Swagger Document 🏗️ (10 minutes) 📄

Learn how to create a Swagger document to describe your API endpoints. 📝

### Swagger Annotations 🚀

Use Swagger annotations in your Java code to describe your API operations, request parameters, and responses. For example:

```Java
@ApiOperation(value = "Get a list of users")
@GetMapping("/users")
public List<User> getUsers() {
    // ...
}
```

## 5. Defining APIs with Swagger 📦 (10 minutes) 📦

Explore how to define complex APIs, including request and response models. 📂

### Request and Response Models 🎁

Swagger allows you to define models for your request and response payloads. For instance:

```Java
@ApiModel(description = "User information")
public class User {
    @ApiModelProperty(notes = "The user's name")
    private String name;
    // ...
}
```

## 6. Swagger Editor and UI 🏭 (5 minutes) 🖥️

Discover Swagger's built-in tools for creating and visualizing API documentation. 🌐

### Swagger Editor ✏️

Use the Swagger Editor to write and validate your Swagger documents. It provides real-time feedback on your API definitions.

## 7. Documenting API Endpoints 🔍 (10 minutes) 📋
![How to Write API Documentation with Examples](https://document360.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ulitmate_guide_to_create_api_documentation-scaled.jpg)
Learn how to document your API endpoints effectively, including path parameters and query parameters. 🔍

### Path Parameters 🚶

Swagger allows you to specify path parameters using curly braces in your endpoint URLs, e.g., `/users/{userId}`.

## 8. Generating API Documentation 🧩 (5 minutes) 📃
